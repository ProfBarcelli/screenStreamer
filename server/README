the server dependencies and mbe installed using pip with the following copmmand:

pip install numpy opencv-contrib-python imutils mss PILLOW pyautogui flask

Idea: I should split the screen image into parts and then send them individually such that eahc fit in a single packer
The receiver could then visualize the incoming packet in its position on the screen

I could also make a diff wrt the previous frame and only send the parts that differ.
Perhaps also send the whole thing once every second.
